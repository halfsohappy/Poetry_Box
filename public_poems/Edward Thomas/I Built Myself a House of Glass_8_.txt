I Built Myself a House of Glass
Edward Thomas

I BUILT myself a house of glass: 
 It took me years to make it: 
 And I was proud. But now, alas, 
 Would God someone would break it. 
 But it looks too magnificent. 
 No neighbour casts a stone 
 From where he dwells, in tenement 
 Or palace of glass, alone.
