Life

"What is this world?­thy school, O misery! 
 "Our only lesson is to learn to suffer." 
  
 - YOUNG. 
  
  
 LOVE, thou sportive fickle boy, 
 Source of anguish, child of joy, 
 Ever wounding­ever smiling, 
 Soothing still, and still beguiling; 
 What are all thy boasted treasures, 
 Tender sorrows, transient pleasures? 
 Anxious hopes, and jealous fears, 
 LAUGHING HOURS, and MOURNING YEARS. 
  
 What is FRIENDSHIP'S soothing name? 
 But a shad'wy, vap'rish flame; 
 Fancy's balm for ev'ry wound, 
 Ever sought, but rarely found; 
 What is BEAUTY ? but a flow'r, 
 Blooming, fading in an hour; 
 Deck'd with brightest tints at morn, 
 At twilight with'ring on a thorn; 
 Like the gentle Rose of spring, 
 Chill'd by ev'ry zephyr's wing, 
 Ah! how soon its colour flies, 
 Blushes, trembles, falls, and dies. 
  
 What is YOUTH ? a smiling sorrow, 
 Blithe to day, and sad to-morrow; 
 Never fix'd, for ever ranging, 
 Laughing, weeping, doating, changing; 
 Wild, capricious, giddy, vain, 
 Cloy'd with pleasure, nurs'd with pain; 
 AGE steals on with wint'ry face, 
 Ev'ry rapt'rous Hope to chase; 
 Like a wither'd, sapless tree, 
 Bow'd to chilling Fate's decree; 
 Strip'd of all its foliage gay, 
 Drooping at the close of day; 
 What of tedious Life remains? 
 Keen regrets and cureless pains; 
 Till DEATH appears, a welcome friend, 
 To bid the scene of sorrow end.
