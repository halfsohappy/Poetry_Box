Dreams
Anne Bronte

While on my lonely couch I lie, 
 I seldom feel myself alone, 
 For fancy fills my dreaming eye 
 With scenes and pleasures of its own. 
 Then I may cherish at my breast 
 An infant's form beloved and fair, 
 May smile and soothe it into rest 
 With all a Mother's fondest care. 
  
 How sweet to feel its helpless form 
 Depending thus on me alone! 
 And while I hold it safe and warm 
 What bliss to think it is my own! 
  
 And glances then may meet my eyes 
 That daylight never showed to me; 
 What raptures in my bosom rise, 
 Those earnest looks of love to see, 
  
 To feel my hand so kindly prest, 
 To know myself beloved at last, 
 To think my heart has found a rest, 
 My life of solitude is past! 
  
 But then to wake and find it flown, 
 The dream of happiness destroyed, 
 To find myself unloved, alone, 
 What tongue can speak the dreary void? 
  
 A heart whence warm affections flow, 
 Creator, thou hast given to me, 
 And am I only thus to know 
 How sweet the joys of love would be?
