To Harriet
Percy Bysshe Shelley

It is not blasphemy to hope that Heaven 
 More perfectly will give those nameless joys 
 Which throb within the pulses of the blood 
 And sweeten all that bitterness which Earth 
 Infuses in the heaven-born soul. O thou 
 Whose dear love gleamed upon the gloomy path 
 Which this lone spirit travelled, drear and cold, 
 Yet swiftly leading to those awful limits 
 Which mark the bounds of Time and of the space 
 When Time shall be no more; wilt thou not turn 
 Those spirit-beaming eyes and look on me, 
 Until I be assured that Earth is Heaven, 
 And Heaven is Earth?--will not thy glowing cheek, 
 Glowing with soft suffusion, rest on mine, 
 And breathe magnetic sweetness through the frame 
 Of my corporeal nature, through the soul 
 Now knit with these fine fibres? I would give 
 The longest and the happiest day that fate 
 Has marked on my existence but to feel 
 ONE soul-reviving kiss...O thou most dear, 
 'Tis an assurance that this Earth is Heaven, 
 And Heaven the flower of that untainted seed 
 Which springeth here beneath such love as ours. 
 Harriet! let death all mortal ties dissolve, 
 But ours shall not be mortal! The cold hand 
 Of Time may chill the love of earthly minds 
 Half frozen now; the frigid intercourse 
 Of common souls lives but a summer's day; 
 It dies, where it arose, upon this earth. 
 But ours! oh, 'tis the stretch of Fancy's hope 
 To portray its continuance as now, 
 Warm, tranquil, spirit-healing; nor when age 
 Has tempered these wild ecstasies, and given 
 A soberer tinge to the luxurious glow 
 Which blazing on devotion's pinnacle 
 Makes virtuous passion supersede the power 
 Of reason; nor when life's aestival sun 
 To deeper manhood shall have ripened me; 
 Nor when some years have added judgement's store 
 To all thy woman sweetness, all the fire 
 Which throbs in thine enthusiast heart; not then 
 Shall holy friendship (for what other name 
 May love like ours assume?), not even then 
 Shall Custom so corrupt, or the cold forms 
 Of this desolate world so harden us, 
 As when we think of the dear love that binds 
 Our souls in soft communion, while we know 
 Each other's thoughts and feelings, can we say 
 Unblushingly a heartless compliment, 
 Praise, hate, or love with the unthinking world, 
 Or dare to cut the unrelaxing nerve 
 That knits our love to virtue. Can those eyes, 
 Beaming with mildest radiance on my heart 
 To purify its purity, e'er bend 
 To soothe its vice or consecrate its fears? 
 Never, thou second Self! Is confidence 
 So vain in virtue that I learn to doubt 
 The mirror even of Truth? Dark flood of Time, 
 Roll as it listeth thee; I measure not 
 By month or moments thy ambiguous course. 
 Another may stand by me on thy brink,, 
 And watch the bubble whirled beyond his ken, 
 Which pauses at my feet. The sense of love, 
 The thirst for action, and the impassioned thought 
 Prolong my being; if I wake no more, 
 My life more actual living will contain 
 Than some gray veteran's of the world's cold school, 
 Whose listless hours unprofitably roll 
 By one enthusiast feeling unredeemed, 
 Virtue and Love! unbending Fortitude, 
 Freedom, Devotedness and Purity! 
 That life my Spirit consecrates to you.
