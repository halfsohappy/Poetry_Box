Translation of the Nurse's Dole in the _Medea_ of Euripides
George Gordon, Lord Byron

OH how I wish that an embargo 
 Had kept in port the good ship Argo! 
 Who, still unlaunched from Grecian docks, 
 Had never passed the Azure rocks; 
 But now I fear her trip will be a 
 Damn'd business for my Miss Medea, etc., etc.
