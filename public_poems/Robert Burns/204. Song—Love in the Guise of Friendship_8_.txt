204. Songâ€”Love in the Guise of Friendship
Robert Burns

YOUR friendship much can make me blest, 
   O why that bliss destroy! 
 Why urge the only, one request 
   You know I will deny! 
  
  
 Your thought, if Love must harbour there, 
   Conceal it in that thought; 
 Nor cause me from my bosom tear 
   The very friend I sought.
