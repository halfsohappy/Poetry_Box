To Mr. Murray
George Gordon, Lord Byron

FOR Orford and for Waldegrave 
 You give much more than me you _gave_; 
 Which is not fairly to behave, 
             My Murray! 
  
 Because if a live dog, 't is said, 
 Be worth a lion fairly sped, 
 A live lord must be worth _two_ dead, 
             My Murray! 
  
 And if, as the opinion goes, 
 Verse hath a better sale than prose,-- 
 Certes, I should have more than those, 
             My Murray! 
  
 But now this sheet is nearly crammed, 
 So, if _you will_, _I_ shan't be shammed, 
 And if you _won't_,--_you_ may be damned, 
             My Murray!
