To --
Percy Bysshe Shelley

When passion's trance is overpast, 
 If tenderness and truth could last, 
 Or live, whilst all wild feelings keep 
 Some mortal slumber, dark and deep, 
 I should not weep, I should not weep! 
  
 It were enough to feel, to see, 
 Thy soft eyes gazing tenderly, 
 And dream the rest--and burn and be 
 The secret food of fires unseen, 
 Couldst thou but be as thou hast been, 
  
 After the slumber of the year 
 The woodland violets reappear; 
 All things revive in field or grove, 
 And sky and sea, but two, which move 
 And form all others, life and love.
