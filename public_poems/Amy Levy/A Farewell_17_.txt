A Farewell
Amy Levy

(After Heine.) 
  
  
 The sad rain falls from Heaven, 
 A sad bird pipes and sings ; 
 I am sitting here at my window 
 And watching the spires of "King's." 
  
 O fairest of all fair places, 
 Sweetest of all sweet towns! 
 With the birds, and the greyness and greenness, 
 And the men in caps and gowns. 
  
 All they that dwell within thee, 
 To leave are ever loth, 
 For one man gets friends, and another 
 Gets honour, and one gets both. 
  
 The sad rain falls from Heaven; 
 My heart is great with woe-- 
 I have neither a friend nor honour, 
 Yet I am sorry to go.
