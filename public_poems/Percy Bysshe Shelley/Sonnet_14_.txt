Sonnet
Percy Bysshe Shelley

Ye hasten to the grave! What seek ye there, 
 Ye restless thoughts and busy purposes 
 Of the idle brain, which the world's livery wear? 
 O thou quick heart, which pantest to possess 
 All that pale Expectation feigneth fair! 
 Thou vainly curious mind which wouldest guess 
 Whence thou didst come, and whither thou must go, 
 And all that never yet was known would know-- 
 Oh, whither hasten ye, that thus ye press, 
 With such swift feet life's green and pleasant path, 
 Seeking, alike from happiness and woe, 
 A refuge in the cavern of gray death? 
 O heart, and mind, and thoughts! what thing do you 
 Hope to inherit in the grave below?
