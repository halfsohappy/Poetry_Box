Retirement
Anne Bronte

O, let me be alone a while, 
 No human form is nigh. 
 And may I sing and muse aloud, 
 No mortal ear is by. 
 Away! ye dreams of earthly bliss, 
 Ye earthly cares begone: 
 Depart! ye restless wandering thoughts, 
 And let me be alone! 
  
 One hour, my spirit, stretch thy wings, 
 And quit this joyless sod, 
 Bask in the sunshine of the sky, 
 And be alone with God!
