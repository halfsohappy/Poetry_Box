A Fragment
George Gordon, Lord Byron

Could I remount the river of my years 
 To the first fountain of our smiles and tears, 
 I would not trace again the stream of hours 
 Between their outworn banks of withered flowers, 
 But bid it flow as now--until it glides 
 Into the number of the nameless tides. 
  
 What is this Death?--a quiet of the heart? 
 The whole of that of which we are a part? 
 For Life is but a vision--what I see 
 Of all which lives alone is Life to me, 
 And being so--the absent are the dead, 
 Who haunt us from tranquillity, and spread 
 A dreary shroud around us, and invest 
 With sad remembrancers our hours of rest. 
   The absent are the dead--for they are cold, 
 And ne'er can be what once we did behold; 
 And they are changed, and cheerless,--or if yet 
 The unforgotten do not all forget, 
 Since thus divided--equal must it be 
 If the deep barrier be of earth, or sea; 
 It may be both--but one day end it must 
 In the dark union of insensate dust. 
   The under-earth inhabitants--are they 
 But mingled millions decomposed to clay? 
 The ashes of a thousand ages spread 
 Wherever Man has trodden or shall tread? 
 Or do they in their silent cities dwell 
 Each in his incommunicative cell? 
 Or have they their own language? and a sense 
 Of breathless being?--darkened and intense 
 As Midnight in her solitude?--Oh Earth! 
 Where are the past?--and wherefore had they birth? 
 The dead are thy inheritors--and we 
 But bubbles on thy surface; and the key 
 Of thy profundity is in the Grave, 
 The ebon portal of thy peopled cave, 
 Where I would walk in spirit, and behold 
 Our elements resolved to things untold, 
 And fathom hidden wonders, and explore 
 The essence of great bosoms now no more.
