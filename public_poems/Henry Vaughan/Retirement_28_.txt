Retirement
Henry Vaughan

Fresh fields and woods! the Earth's fair face, 
 God's foot-stool, and man's dwelling-place. 
 I ask not why the first Believer 
 Did love to be a country liver? 
 Who to secure pious content 
 Did pitch by groves and wells his tent; 
 Where he might view the boundless sky, 
 And all those glorious lights on high; 
 With flying meteors, mists and show'rs, 
 Subjected hills, trees, meads and flow'rs; 
 And ev'ry minute bless the King 
 And wise Creator of each thing. 
 I ask not why he did remove 
 To happy Mamre's holy grove, 
 Leaving the cities of the plain 
 To Lot and his successless train? 
 All various lusts in cities still 
 Are found; they are the thrones of ill; 
 The dismal sinks, where blood is spill'd, 
 Cages with much uncleanness fill'd. 
 But rural shades are the sweet fense 
 Of piety and innocence. 
 They are the Meek's calm region, where 
 Angels descend and rule the sphere, 
 Where heaven lies leiger, and the dove 
 Duly as dew, comes from above. 
 If Eden be on Earth at all, 
 'Tis that, which we the country call.
