Digging
Edward Thomas

WHAT matter makes my spade for tears or mirth, 
 Letting down two clay pipes into the earth? 
 The one I smoked, the other a soldier 
 Of Blenheim, Ramillies, and Malplaquet 
 Perhaps. The dead man's immortality 
 Lies represented lightly with my own, 
 A yard or two nearer the living air 
 Than bones of ancients who, amazed to see 
 Almighty God erect the mastodon, 
 Once laughed, or wept, in this same light of day.
