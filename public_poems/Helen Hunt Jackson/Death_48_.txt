Death
Helen Hunt Jackson

My body, eh? Friend Death, how now? 
 Why all this tedious pomp of writ? 
 Thou hast reclaimed it sure and slow 
 For half a century bit by bit. 
  
 In faith thou knowest more to-day 
 Than I do, where it can be found! 
 This shrivelled lump of suffering clay, 
 To which I am now chained and bound, 
  
 Has not of kith or kin a trace 
 To the good body once I bore; 
 Look at this shrunken, ghastly face: 
 Didst ever see that face before? 
  
 Ah, well, friend Death, good friend thou art; 
 Thy only fault thy lagging gait, 
 Mistaken pity in thy heart 
 For timorous ones that bid thee wait. 
  
 Do quickly all thou hast to do, 
 Nor I nor mine will hindrance make; 
 I shall be free when thou art through; 
 I grudge thee nought that thou must take! 
  
 Stay! I have lied; I grudge thee one, 
 Yes, two I grudge thee at this last,-- 
 Two members which have faithful done 
 My will and bidding in the past. 
  
 I grudge thee this right hand of mine; 
 I grudge thee this quick-beating heart; 
 They never gave me coward sign, 
 Nor played me once the traitor's part. 
  
 I see now why in olden days 
 Men in barbaric love or hate 
 Nailed enemies' hands at wild crossways, 
 Shrined leaders' hearts in costly state: 
  
 The symbol, sign and instrument 
 Of each soul's purpose, passion, strife, 
 Of fires in which are poured and spent 
 Their all of love, their all of life. 
  
 O feeble, mighty human hand! 
 O fragile, dauntless human heart! 
 The universe holds nothing planned 
 With such sublime, transcendent art! 
  
 Yes, Death, I own I grudge thee mine 
 Poor little hand, so feeble now; 
 Its wrinkled palm, its altered line, 
 Its veins so pallid and so slow -- 
  
 Ah, well, friend Death, good friend thou art; 
 I shall be free when thou art through. 
 Take all there is -- take hand and heart; 
 There must be somewhere work to do.
