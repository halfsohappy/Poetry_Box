Death
John Clare

Why should man's high aspiring mind 
 Burn in him with so proud a breath, 
 When all his haughty views can find 
   In this world yields to death? 
 The fair, the brave, the vain, the wise, 
 The rich, the poor, the great, and small, 
 Are each but worm's anatomies 
   To strew his quiet hall. 
  
 Power may make many earthly gods, 
 Where gold and bribery's guilt prevails, 
 But death's unwelcome, honest odds 
   Kick o'er the unequal scales. 
 The flattered great may clamours raise 
 Of power, and their own weakness hide, 
 But death shall find unlooked-for ways 
   To end the farce of pride, 
  
 An arrow hurtled eer so high, 
 From een a giant's sinewy strength, 
 In Time's untraced eternity 
   Goes but a pigmy length; 
 Nay, whirring from the tortured string, 
 With all its pomp of hurried flight, 
 Tis by the skylark's little wing 
   Outmeasured in its height. 
  
 Just so man's boasted strength and power 
 Shall fade before death's lightest stroke, 
 Laid lower than the meanest flower, 
   Whose pride oer-topt the oak; 
 And he who, like a blighting blast, 
 Dispeopled worlds with war's alarms 
 Shall be himself destroyed at last 
   By poor despised worms. 
  
 Tyrants in vain their powers secure, 
 And awe slaves' murmurs with a frown, 
 For unawed death at last is sure 
   To sap the babels down. 
 A stone thrown upward to the sky 
 Will quickly meet the ground agen; 
 So men-gods of earth's vanity 
   Shall drop at last to men; 
  
 And Power and Pomp their all resign, 
 Blood-purchased thrones and banquet halls. 
 Fate waits to sack Ambition's shrine 
   As bare as prison walls, 
 Where the poor suffering wretch bows down 
 To laws a lawless power hath passed; 
 And pride, and power, and king, and clown 
   Shall be Death's slaves at last. 
  
 Time, the prime minister of Death! 
 There's nought can bribe his honest will. 
 He stops the richest tyrant's breath 
   And lays his mischief still. 
 Each wicked scheme for power all stops, 
 With grandeurs false and mock display, 
 As eve's shades from high mountain tops 
   Fade with the rest away. 
  
 Death levels all things in his march; 
 Nought can resist his mighty strength; 
 The palace proud, triumphal arch, 
   Shall mete its shadow's length. 
 The rich, the poor, one common bed 
 Shall find in the unhonoured grave, 
 Where weeds shall crown alike the head 
   Of tyrant and of slave.
