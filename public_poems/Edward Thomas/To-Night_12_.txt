To-Night
Edward Thomas

HARRY, you know at night 
 The larks in Castle Alley 
 Sing from the attic's height 
 As if the electric light 
 Were the true sun above a summer valley: 
 Whistle, don't knock, to-night. 
  
 I shall come early, Kate: 
 And we in Castle Alley 
 Will sit close out of sight 
 Alone, and ask no light 
 Of lamp or sun above a summer valley: 
 To-night I can stay late.
