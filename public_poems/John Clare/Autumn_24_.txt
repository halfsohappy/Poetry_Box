Autumn
John Clare

I love the fitful gust that shakes 
   The casement all the day, 
 And from the glossy elm tree takes 
   The faded leaves away, 
 Twirling them by the window pane 
 With thousand others down the lane. 
  
 I love to see the shaking twig 
   Dance till the shut of eve, 
 The sparrow on the cottage rig, 
   Whose chirp would make believe 
 That Spring was just now flirting by 
 In Summer's lap with flowers to lie. 
  
 I love to see the cottage smoke 
   Curl upwards through the trees, 
 The pigeons nestled round the cote 
   On November days like these; 
 The cock upon the dunghill crowing, 
 The mill sails on the heath a-going. 
  
 The feather from the raven's breast 
   Falls on the stubble lea, 
 The acorns near the old crow's nest 
   Drop pattering down the tree; 
 The grunting pigs, that wait for all, 
 Scramble and hurry where they fall.
