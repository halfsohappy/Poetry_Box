Song
John Clare

One gloomy eve I roamed about 
   Neath Oxey's hazel bowers, 
 While timid hares were darting out, 
   To crop the dewy flowers; 
 And soothing was the scene to me, 
   Right pleased was my soul, 
 My breast was calm as summer's sea 
   When waves forget to roll. 
  
 But short was even's placid smile, 
   My startled soul to charm, 
 When Nelly lightly skipt the stile, 
   With milk-pail on her arm: 
 One careless look on me she flung, 
   As bright as parting day; 
 And like a hawk from covert sprung, 
   It pounced my peace away.
