Song of Proserpine While Gathering Flowers on the Plain of Enna
Percy Bysshe Shelley

Sacred Goddess, Mother Earth, 
 Thou from whose immortal bosom 
 Gods, and men, and beasts have birth, 
 Leaf and blade, and bud and blossom, 
 Breathe thine influence most divine 
 On thine own child, Proserpine. 
  
 If with mists of evening dew 
 Thou dost nourish these young flowers 
 Till they grow, in scent and hue, 
 Fairest children of the Hours, 
 Breathe thine influence most divine 
 On thine own child, Proserpine.
