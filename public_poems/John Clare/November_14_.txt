November
John Clare

Sybil of months, and worshipper of winds, 
   I love thee, rude and boisterous as thou art; 
 And scraps of joy my wandering ever finds 
   Mid thy uproarious madness--when the start 
 Of sudden tempests stirs the forest leaves 
   Into hoarse fury, till the shower set free 
 Stills the huge swells. Then ebb the mighty heaves, 
   That sway the forest like a troubled sea. 
 I love thy wizard noise, and rave in turn 
   Half-vacant thoughts and rhymes of careless form; 
 Then hide me from the shower, a short sojourn, 
   Neath ivied oak; and mutter to the storm, 
 Wishing its melody belonged to me, 
 That I might breathe a living song to thee.
