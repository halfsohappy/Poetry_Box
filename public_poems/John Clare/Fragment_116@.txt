Fragment
John Clare

In a huge cloud of mountain hue 
 The sun sets dark nor shudders through 
 One single beam to shine again 
 Tis night already in the lane 
  
 The settled clouds in ridges lie 
 And some swell mountains calm and high 
  
 Clouds rack and drive before the wind 
 In shapes and forms of every kind 
 Like waves that rise without the roars 
 And rocks that guard untrodden shores 
 Now castles pass majestic bye 
 And ships in peaceful havens lie 
 These gone ten thousand shapes ensue 
 For ever beautiful and new 
  
 The scattered clouds lie calm and still 
 And day throws gold on every hill 
 Their thousand heads in glorys run 
 As each were worlds and owned a sun 
 The rime it clings to every thing 
 It beards the early buds of spring 
 The mossy pales the orchard spray 
 Are feathered with its silver grey 
  
 Rain drizzles in the face so small 
 We scarce can say it rains at all 
  
 The cows turned to the pelting rain 
 No longer at their feed remain 
 But in the sheltering hovel hides 
 That from two propping dotterels strides 
  
 The sky was hilled with red and blue 
 With lighter shadows waking through 
 Till beautiful and beaming day 
 Shed streaks of gold for miles away 
  
 The linnet stopt her song to clean 
 Her spreading wings of yellow green 
 And turn his head as liking well 
 To smooth the dropples as they fell 
  
 One scarce could keep one's path aright 
 From gazing upward at the sight 
  
 The boys for wet are forced to pass 
 The cuckoo flowers among the grass 
 To hasten on as well they may 
 For hedge or tree or stack of hay 
 Where they for shelter can abide 
 Safe seated by its sloping side 
 That by the blackthorn thicket cowers 
 A shelter in the strongest showers 
  
 The gardens golden gilliflowers 
 Are paled with drops of amber showers 
  
 Dead leaves from hedges flirt about 
 The chaff from barn doors winnows out 
 And down without a wing to flye 
 As fast as bees goes sailing bye 
 The feather finds a wing to flye 
 And dust in wirl puffs winnows bye 
  
 When the rain at midday stops 
 Spangles glitter in the drops 
 And as each thread a sunbeam was 
 Cobwebs glitter in the grass 
  
 The sheep all loaded with the rain 
 Try to shake it off in vain 
 And ere dryed by wind and sun 
 The load will scarcely let them run 
  
 The shepherds foot is sodden through 
 And leaves will clout his brushing shoe 
 The buttercups in gold alloyed 
 And daiseys by the shower destroyed 
  
 The sun is overcast clouds lie 
 And thicken over all the sky 
  
 Crows morn and eve will flock in crowds 
 To fens and darken like the clouds 
 So many is their cumberous flight 
 The dull eve darkens into night 
  
 Clouds curl and curdle blue and grey 
 And dapple the young summers day 
  
 Through the torn woods the violent rain 
 Roars and rattles oer the plain 
 And bubbles up in every pool 
 Till dykes and ponds are brimming full 
  
 The thickening clouds move slowly on 
 Till all the many clouds are one 
 That spreads oer all the face of day 
 And turns the sunny shine to grey 
  
 Now the meadow water smokes 
 And hedgerows dripping oaks 
 Fitter patter all around 
 And dimple the once dusty ground 
 The spinners threads about the weeds 
 Are hung with little drops in beads 
 Clover silver green becomes 
 And purple blue surrounds the plumbs 
 And every place breaths fresh and fair 
 When morning pays her visit there 
  
 The day is dull the heron trails 
 On flapping wings like heavy sails 
 And oer the mead so lowly swings 
 She fans the herbage with her wings 
  
 The waterfowl with suthering wings 
 Dive down the river splash and spring 
 Up to the very clouds again 
 That sprinkle scuds of coming rain 
 That flye and drizzle all the day 
 Till dripping grass is turned to grey 
  
 The various clouds that move or lye 
 Like mighty travellers in the sky 
 All mountainously ridged or curled 
 That may have travelled round the world 
  
 The water ruckles into waves 
 And loud the neighbouring woodland raves 
 All telling of the coming storm 
 That fills the village with alarm 
  
 Ere yet the sun is two hours high 
 Winds find all quarters of the sky 
 With sudden shiftings all around 
 And now the grass upon the ground 
 And now the leaves they wirl and wirl 
 With many a flirting flap and curl
