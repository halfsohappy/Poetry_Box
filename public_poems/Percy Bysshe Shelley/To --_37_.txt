DAKRTSI DIOISO POTMON 'APOTMON. 
  
 Oh! there are spirits of the air, 
 And genii of the evening breeze, 
 And gentle ghosts, with eyes as fair 
 As star-beams among twilight trees:-- 
 Such lovely ministers to meet 
 Oft hast thou turned from men thy lonely feet. 
  
 With mountain winds, and babbling springs, 
 And moonlight seas, that are the voice 
 Of these inexplicable things, 
 Thou didst hold commune, and rejoice 
 When they did answer thee; but they 
 Cast, like a worthless boon, thy love away. 
  
 And thou hast sought in starry eyes 
 Beams that were never meant for thine, 
 Another's wealth:--tame sacrifice 
 To a fond faith! still dost thou pine? 
 Still dost thou hope that greeting hands, 
 Voice, looks, or lips, may answer thy demands? 
  
 Ah! wherefore didst thou build thine hope 
 On the false earth's inconstancy? 
 Did thine own mind afford no scope 
 Of love, or moving thoughts to thee? 
 That natural scenes or human smiles 
 Could steal the power to wind thee in their wiles? 
  
 Yes, all the faithless smiles are fled 
 Whose falsehood left thee broken-hearted; 
 The glory of the moon is dead; 
 Night's ghosts and dreams have now departed; 
 Thine own soul still is true to thee, 
 But changed to a foul fiend through misery. 
  
 This fiend, whose ghastly presence ever 
 Beside thee like thy shadow hangs, 
 Dream not to chase;--the mad endeavour 
 Would scourge thee to severer pangs. 
 Be as thou art. Thy settled fate, 
 Dark as it is, all change would aggravate.
