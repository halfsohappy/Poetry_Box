A Farewell
Charles Kingsley

I 
  
 My fairest child, I have no song to give you; 
 No lark could pipe to skies so dull and grey: 
 Yet, ere we part, one lesson I can leave you 
 For every day. 
  
 II 
  
 Be good, sweet maid, and let who will be clever; 
 Do noble things, not dream them, all day long: 
 And so make life, death, and that vast for-ever 
 One grand, sweet song.
