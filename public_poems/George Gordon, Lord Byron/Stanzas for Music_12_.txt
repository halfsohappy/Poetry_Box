Stanzas for Music
George Gordon, Lord Byron

They say that Hope is happiness; 
   But genuine Love must prize the past, 
 And Memory wakes the thoughts that bless: 
   They rose the first--they set the last; 
  
 And all that Memory loves the most 
   Was once our only Hope to be, 
 And all that Hope adored and lost 
   Hath melted into Memory. 
  
 Alas! it is delusion all: 
   The future cheats us from afar, 
 Nor can we be what we recall, 
   Nor dare we think on what we are.
