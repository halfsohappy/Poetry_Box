An Old Song
Edward Thomas

THE sun set, the wind fell, the sea 
 Was like a mirror shaking: 
 The one small wave that clapped the land 
 A mile-long snake of foam was making 
 Where tide had smoothed and wind had dried 
 The vacant sand. 
  
 A light divided the swollen clouds 
 And lay most perfectly 
 Like a straight narrow footbridge bright 
 That crossed over the sea to me; 
 And no one else in the whole world 
 Saw that same sight. 
  
 I walked elate, my bridge always 
 Just one step from my feet: 
 A robin sang, a shade in shade: 
 And all I did was to repeat: 
 "I'll go no more a-roving 
 With you, fair maid." 
  
 The sailors' song of merry loving 
 With dusk and sea-gull's mewing 
 Mixed sweet, the lewdness far outweighed 
 By the wild charm the chorus played: 
 "I'll go no more a-roving 
 With you, fair maid: 
 A-roving, a-roving, since roving's been my ruin, 
 I'll go no more a-roving with you, fair maid." 
  
 _In Amsterdam there dwelt a maid-- 
 Mark well what I do say-- 
 In Amsterdam there dwelt a maid 
 And she was a mistress of her trade: 
 I'll go no more a-roving 
 With you, fair maid: 
 A-roving, a-roving, since roving's been my ruin, 
 I'll go no more a-roving with you, fair maid._
