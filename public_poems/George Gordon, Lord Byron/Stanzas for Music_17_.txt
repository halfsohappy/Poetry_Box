Stanzas for Music
George Gordon, Lord Byron

There be none of Beauty's daughters 
   With a magic like thee; 
 And like music on the waters 
   Is thy sweet voice to me: 
 When, as if its sound were causing 
 The charm√©d Ocean's pausing, 
 The waves lie still and gleaming, 
 And the lulled winds seem dreaming: 
  
 And the midnight Moon is weaving 
   Her bright chain o'er the deep; 
 Whose breast is gently heaving, 
   As an infant's asleep: 
 So the spirit bows before thee, 
 To listen and adore thee; 
 With a full but soft emotion, 
 Like the swell of Summer's ocean.
