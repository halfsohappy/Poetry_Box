Stars
Emily Bronte

Ah! why, because the dazzling sun 
 Restored our Earth to joy, 
 Have you departed, every one, 
 And left a desert sky? 
  
 All through the night, your glorious eyes 
 Were gazing down in mine, 
 And, with a full heart's thankful sighs, 
 I blessed that watch divine. 
  
 I was at peace, and drank your beams 
 As they were life to me; 
 And revelled in my changeful dreams, 
 Like petrel on the sea. 
  
 Thought followed thought, star followed star 
 Through boundless regions on; 
 While one sweet influence, near and far, 
 Thrilled through, and proved us one! 
  
 Why did the morning dawn to break 
 So great, so pure a spell; 
 And scorch with fire the tranquil cheek, 
 Where your cool radiance fell? 
  
 Blood-red, he rose, and arrow-straight, 
 His fierce beams struck my brow; 
 The soul of nature sprang, elate, 
 But mine sank sad and low. 
  
 My lids closed down, yet through their veil 
 I saw him, blazinig, still, 
 And steep in gold the misty dale, 
 And flash upon the hill. 
  
 I turned me to the pillow, then, 
 To call back night, and see 
 Your words of solemn light, again, 
 Throb with my heart, and me! 
  
 It would not do - the pillow glowed, 
 And glowed both roof and floor; 
 And birds sang loudly in the wood, 
 And fresh winds shook the door; 
  
 The curtains waved, the wakened flies 
 Were murmuring round my room, 
 Imprisoned there, till I should rise, 
 And give them leave to roam. 
  
 O stars, and dreams, and gentle night; 
 O night and stars, return! 
 And hide me from the hostile light 
 That does not warm, but burn; 
  
 That drains the blood of suffering men; 
 Drinks tears, instead of dew; 
 Let me sleep through his blinding reign, 
 And only wake with you!
