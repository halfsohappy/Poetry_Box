To Harriet
George Gordon, Lord Byron

Harriet! to see such Circumspection, 
 In Ladies I have no objection 
   Concerning what they read; 
 An ancient Maid's a sage adviser, 
 Like _her_, you will be much the wiser, 
   In word, as well as Deed. 
  
 But Harriet, I don't wish to flatter, 
 And really think 't would make the matter 
   More perfect if not quite, 
 If other Ladies when they preach, 
 Would certain Damsels also teach 
   More cautiously to write.
