Prayer
Richard Crashaw

LO here a little volume, but great Book 
 A nest of new-born sweets; 
 Whose native fires disdaining 
 To ly thus folded, and complaining 
 Of these ignoble sheets, 
 Affect more comly bands 
 (Fair one) from the kind hands 
 And confidently look 
 To find the rest 
 Of a rich binding in your Brest. 
 It is, in one choise handfull, heavenn; and all 
 Heavn’s Royall host; incamp’t thus small 
 To prove that true schooles use to tell, 
 Ten thousand Angels in one point can dwell. 
 It is love’s great artillery 
 Which here contracts itself, and comes to ly 
 Close couch’t in their white bosom: and from thence 
 As from a snowy fortresse of defence, 
 Against their ghostly foes to take their part, 
 And fortify the hold of their chast heart. 
 It is an armory of light 
 Let constant use but keep it bright, 
 You’l find it yeilds 
 To holy hands and humble hearts 
 More swords and sheilds 
 Then sin hath snares, or Hell hath darts. 
 Only be sure 
 The hands be pure 
 That hold these weapons; and the eyes 
 Those of turtles, chast and true; 
 Wakefull and wise; 
 Here is a freind shall fight for you, 
 Hold but this book before their heart; 
 Let prayer alone to play his part, 
 But ф the heart 
 That studyes this high Art 
 Must be a sure house-keeper 
 And yet no sleeper. 
 Dear soul, be strong. 
 Mercy will come e’re long 
 And bring his bosom fraught with blessings, 
 Flowers of never fading graces 
 To make immortall dressings 
 For worthy soules, whose wise embraces 
 Store up themselves for Him, who is alone 
 The Spouse of Virgins and the Virgin’s son. 
 But if the noble Bridegroom, when he come 
 Shall find the loytering Heart from home; 
 Leaving her chast aboad 
 To gadde abroad 
 Among the gay mates of the god of flyes; 
 To take her pleasure and to play 
 And keep the devill’s holyday; 
 To dance th’sunshine of some smiling 
 But beguiling 
 Spheares of sweet and sugred Lyes, 
 Some slippery Pair 
 Of false, perhaps as fair, 
 Flattering but forswearing eyes; 
 Doubtlesse some other heart 
 Will gett the start 
 Mean while, and stepping in before 
 Will take possession of that sacred store 
 Of hidden sweets and holy ioyes. 
 Words which are not heard with Eares 
 (Those tumultuous shops of noise) 
 Effectuall wispers, whose still voice 
 The soul it selfe more feeles then heares; 
 Amorous languishments; luminous trances; 
 Sights which are not seen with eyes; 
 Spirituall and soul-peircing glances 
 Whose pure and subtil lightning flyes 
 Home to the heart, and setts the house on fire 
 And melts it down in sweet desire 
 Yet does not stay 
 To ask the windows leave to passe that way; 
 Delicious Deaths; soft exalations 
 Of soul; dear and divine annihilations; 
 A thousand unknown rites 
 Of ioyes and rarefy’d delights; 
 A hundred thousand goods, glories, and graces, 
 And many a mystick thing 
 Which the divine embraces 
 Of the deare spouse of spirits with them will bring 
 For which it is no shame 
 That dull mortality must not know a name. 
 Of all this store 
 Of blessings and ten thousand more 
 (If when he come 
 He find the Heart from home) 
 Doubtlesse he will unload 
 Himself some other where, 
 And poure abroad 
 His pretious sweets 
 On the fair soul whom first he meets. 
 O fair, ф fortunate! O riche, ф dear! 
 O happy and thrice happy she 
 Selected dove 
 Who ere she be, 
 Whose early love 
 With winged vowes 
 Makes hast to meet her morning spouse 
 And close with his immortall kisses. 
 Happy indeed, who never misses 
 To improve that pretious hour, 
 And every day 
 Seize her sweet prey 
 All fresh and fragrant as he rises 
 Dropping with a baulmy Showr 
 A delicious dew of spices; 
 O let the blissfull heart hold fast 
 Her heavnly arm-full, she shall tast 
 At once ten thousand paradises; 
 She shall have power 
 To rifle and deflour 
 The rich and roseall spring of those rare sweets 
 Which with a swelling bosome there she meets 
 Boundles and infinite 
 Bottomles treasures 
 Of pure inebriating pleasures 
 Happy proof! she shal discover 
 What ioy, what blisse, 
 How many Heav’ns at once it is 
 To have her God become her Lover.
