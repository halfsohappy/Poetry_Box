To Mr. Murray
George Gordon, Lord Byron

TO hook the Reader, you, John Murray, 
   Have published "Anjou's Margaret," 
 Which won't be sold off in a hurry 
   (At least, it has not been as yet); 
 And then, still further to bewilder him, 
   Without remorse, you set up "Ilderim;" 
   So mind you don't get into debt,-- 
 Because--as how--if you should fail, 
 These books would be but baddish bail. 
 And mind you do _not_ let escape 
   These rhymes to _Morning Post_ or Perry, 
 Which would be _very_ treacherous--_very_, 
 And get me into such a scrape! 
   For, firstly, I should have to sally, 
   All in my little boat, against a _Galley_; 
 And, should I chance to slay the Assyrian wight, 
 Have next to combat with the female Knight: 
 And pricked to death expire upon her needle, 
 A sort of end which I should take indeed ill!
