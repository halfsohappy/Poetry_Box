Sonnet
Percy Bysshe Shelley

FROM THE ITALIAN OF CAVALCANTI. 
  
 GUIDO CAVALCANTI TO DANTE ALIGHIERI: 
  
 Returning from its daily quest, my Spirit 
 Changed thoughts and vile in thee doth weep to find: 
 It grieves me that thy mild and gentle mind 
 Those ample virtues which it did inherit 
 Has lost. Once thou didst loathe the multitude 
 Of blind and madding men--I then loved thee-- 
 I loved thy lofty songs and that sweet mood 
 When thou wert faithful to thyself and me 
 I dare not now through thy degraded state 
 Own the delight thy strains inspire--in vain 
 I seek what once thou wert--we cannot meet 
 And we were wont. Again and yet again 
 Ponder my words: so the false Spirit shall fly 
 And leave to thee thy true integrity.
