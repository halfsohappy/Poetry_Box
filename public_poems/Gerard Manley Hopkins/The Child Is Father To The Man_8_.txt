The Child Is Father To The Man
Gerard Manley Hopkins

'The child is father to the man.' 
 How can he be? The words are wild. 
 Suck any sense from that who can: 
 'The child is father to the man.' 
 No; what the poet did write ran, 
 'The man is father to the child.' 
 'The child is father to the man!' 
 How can he be? The words are wild.
