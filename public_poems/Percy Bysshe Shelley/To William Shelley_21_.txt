To William Shelley
Percy Bysshe Shelley

(With what truth may I say-- 
 Roma! Roma! Roma! 
 Non e piu come era prima!) 
  
 My lost William, thou in whom 
 Some bright spirit lived, and did 
 That decaying robe consume 
 Which its lustre faintly hid,-- 
 Here its ashes find a tomb, 
 But beneath this pyramid 
 Thou art not--if a thing divine 
 Like thee can die, thy funeral shrine 
 Is thy mother's grief and mine. 
  
 Where art thou, my gentle child? 
 Let me think thy spirit feeds, 
 With its life intense and mild, 
 The love of living leaves and weeds 
 Among these tombs and ruins wild;-- 
 Let me think that through low seeds 
 Of sweet flowers and sunny grass 
 Into their hues and scents may pass 
 A portion--
