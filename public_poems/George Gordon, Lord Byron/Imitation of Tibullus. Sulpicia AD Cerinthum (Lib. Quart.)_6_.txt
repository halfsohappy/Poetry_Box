Imitation of Tibullus. Sulpicia AD Cerinthum (Lib. Quart.)
George Gordon, Lord Byron

Cruel Cerinthus! does the fell disease 
 Which racks my breast your fickle bosom please? 
 Alas! I wish'd but to o'ercome the pain, 
 That I might live for Love and you again; 
 But, now, I scarcely shall bewail my fate: 
 By Death alone I can avoid your hate.
