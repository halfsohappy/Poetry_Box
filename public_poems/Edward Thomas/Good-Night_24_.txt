Good-Night
Edward Thomas

THE skylarks are far behind that sang over the 
     down; 
 I can hear no more those suburb nightingales; 
 Thrushes and blackbirds sing in the gardens of the 
     town 
 In vain: the noise of man, beast, and machine 
     prevails. 
  
 But the call of children in the unfamiliar streets 
 That echo with a familiar twilight echoing, 
 Sweet as the voice of nightingale or lark, completes 
 A magic of strange welcome, so that I seem a king 
  
 Among man, beast, machine, bird, child, and the 
     ghost 
 That in the echo lives and with the echo dies. 
 The friendless town is friendly; homeless, I 
     not lost; 
 Though I know none of these doors, and meet but 
     strangers' eyes. 
  
 Never again, perhaps, after to-morrow, shall 
 I see these homely streets, these church windows 
     alight, 
 Not a man or woman or child among them all: 
 But it is All Friends' Night, a traveller's good 
     night.
