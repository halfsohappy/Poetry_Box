To --
Percy Bysshe Shelley

Yet look on me--take not thine eyes away, 
 Which feed upon the love within mine own, 
 Which is indeed but the reflected ray 
 Of thine own beauty from my spirit thrown. 
 Yet speak to me--thy voice is as the tone 
 Of my heart's echo, and I think I hear 
 That thou yet lovest me; yet thou alone 
 Like one before a mirror, without care 
 Of aught but thine own features, imaged there; 
  
 And yet I wear out life in watching thee; 
 A toil so sweet at times, and thou indeed 
 Art kind when I am sick, and pity me...
