St. John Baptist Painted by her self in the Wilderness, with Angels appearing to him, and with a Lamb by him
Anne Killigrew

THe Sun's my Fire, when it does shine, 
 The hollow Spring's my Cave of Wine, 
 The Rocks and Woods afford me Meat; 
 This Lamb and I on one Dish eat: 
 The neighbouring Herds my Garments send, 
 My Pallet the kind Earth doth lend: 
 Excess and Grandure I decline, 
 M'Associates onely are Divine.
