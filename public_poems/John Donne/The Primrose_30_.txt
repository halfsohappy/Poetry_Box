The Primrose
John Donne

Upon this Primrose hill, 
 Where, if Heav'n would distil 
 A shower of rain, each several drop might go 
 To his own primrose, and grow manna so; 
 And where their form and their infinity 
 Make a terrestrial Galaxy, 
 As the small stars do in the sky: 
 I walk to find a true Love; and I see 
 That 'tis not a mere woman that is she, 
 But must or more or less than woman be. 
  
 Yet know I not which flower 
 I wish; a six, or four; 
 For should my true-Love less than woman be 
 She were scarce any thing; and then, should she 
 Be more than woman she would get above 
 All thought of sex, and think to move 
 My heart to study her, and not to love; 
 Both these were monsters; since there must reside 
 Falsehood in woman, I could more abide 
 She were by art than Nature falsified. 
  
 Live primrose then, and thrive 
 With thy true number five; 
 And woman, whom this flower doth represent, 
 With this mysterious number be content; 
 Ten is the farthest number; if half ten 
 Belong unto each woman, then 
 Each woman may take half us men; 
 Or if this will not serve their turn, since all 
 Numbers are odd or even, and they fall 
 First into this, five, woman may take us all.
