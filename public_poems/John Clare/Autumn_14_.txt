Autumn
John Clare

Autumn comes laden with her ripened load 
 Of fruitage and so scatters them abroad 
 That each fern-smothered heath and mole-hill waste 
 Are black with bramble berries--where in haste 
 The chubby urchins from the village hie 
 To feast them there, stained with the purple dye; 
 While painted woods around my rambles be 
 In draperies worthy of eternity. 
 Yet will the leaves soon patter on the ground, 
 And death's deaf voice awake at every sound: 
 One drops--then others--and the last that fell 
 Rings for those left behind their passing bell. 
 Thus memory every where her tidings brings 
 How sad death robs us of life's dearest things.
