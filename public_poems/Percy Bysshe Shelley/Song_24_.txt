Song
Percy Bysshe Shelley

Fierce roars the midnight storm 
 O'er the wild mountain, 
 Dark clouds the night deform, 
 Swift rolls the fountain-- 
  
 See! o'er yon rocky height, 
 Dim mists are flying-- 
 See by the moon's pale light, 
 Poor Laura's dying! 
  
 Shame and remorse shall howl, 
 By her false pillow-- 
 Fiercer than storms that roll, 
 O'er the white billow; 
  
 No hand her eyes to close, 
 When life is flying, 
 But she will find repose, 
 For Laura's dying! 
  
 Then will I seek my love, 
 Then will I cheer her, 
 Then my esteem will prove, 
 When no friend is near her. 
  
 On her grave I will lie, 
 When life is parted, 
 On her grave I will die, 
 For the false hearted.
