Easter
George Herbert

Rise, heart, thy lord is risen. Sing his praise 
 Without delays, 
 Who takes thee by the hand, that thou likewise 
 With him may'st rise: 
 That, as his death calcinиd thee to dust, 
 His life may make thee gold, and, much more, just. 
  
 Awake, my lute, and struggle for thy part 
 With all thy art, 
 The cross taught all wood to resound his name 
 Who bore the same. 
 His stretchиd sinews taught all strings what key 
 Is best to celebrate this most high day. 
  
 Consort, both heart and lute, and twist a song 
 Pleasant and long; 
 Or, since all music is but three parts vied 
 And multiplied 
 Oh let thy blessиd Spirit bear a part, 
 And make up our defects with his sweet art.
