Prayer
George Herbert

Prayer the Churches banquet, Angels age, 
 Gods breath in man returning to his birth, 
 The soul in paraphrase, heart in pilgramage, 
 The Christian plummet sounding heav'n and earth; 
 Engine against th'Almightie, sinners towre, 
 Reversed thunder, Christ-side-piercing spear, 
 The six-daies world-transposing in an houre, 
 A kinde of tune, which all things heare and fear; 
 Softnesse, and peace, and joy, and love, and blisse, 
 Exalted Manna, gladnesse of the best, 
 Heaven in ordinarie, man well drest, 
 The milkie way, the bird of Paradise, 
 Church-bels beyond the starres heard, the souls bloud, 
 The land of spices; something understood.
