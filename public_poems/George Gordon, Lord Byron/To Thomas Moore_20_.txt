To Thomas Moore
George Gordon, Lord Byron

My boat is on the shore, 
   And my bark is on the sea; 
 But, before I go, Tom Moore, 
   Here's a double health to thee! 
  
 Here's a sigh to those who love me, 
   And a smile to those who hate; 
 And, whatever sky's above me, 
   Here's a heart for every fate. 
  
 Though the Ocean roar around me, 
   Yet it still shall bear me on; 
 Though a desert shall surround me, 
   It hath springs that may be won. 
  
 Were't the last drop in the well, 
   As I gasped upon the brink, 
 Ere my fainting spirit fell, 
   'T is to thee that I would drink. 
  
 With that water, as this wine, 
   The libation I would pour 
 Should be--peace with thine and mine, 
   And a health to thee, Tom Moore.
