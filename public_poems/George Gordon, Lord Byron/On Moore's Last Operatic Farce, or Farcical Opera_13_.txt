On Moore's Last Operatic Farce, or Farcical Opera
George Gordon, Lord Byron

  GOOD plays are scarce, 
   So Moore writes _farce_: 
 The poet's fame grows brittle-- 
   We knew before 
   That _Little_'s Moore, 
 But now't is Moore that's _little_. 
  
                       R.C. DALLAS. 
  
 YES! wisdom shines in all his mien, 
 Which would so captivate, I ween, 
   Wisdom's own goddess Pallas; 
 That she'd discard her fav'rite owl, 
 And take for pet a brother fowl, 
   Sagacious R.C. Dallas.
