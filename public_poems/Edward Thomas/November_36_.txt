November
Edward Thomas

NOVEMBER'S days are thirty: 
 November's earth is dirty, 
 Those thirty days, from first to last; 
 And the prettiest things on ground are the paths 
 With morning and evening hobnails dinted, 
 With foot and wing-tip overprinted 
 Or separately charactered, 
 Of little beast and little bird. 
 The fields are mashed by sheep, the roads 
 Make the worst going, the best the woods 
 Where dead leaves upward and downward scatter. 
 Few care for the mixture of earth and water, 
 Twig, leaf, flint, thorn, 
 Straw, feather, all that men scorn, 
 Pounded up and sodden by flood, 
 Condemned as mud. 
  
 But of all the months when earth is greener 
 Not one has clean skies that are cleaner. 
 Clean and clear and sweet and cold, 
 They shine above the earth so old, 
 While the after-tempest cloud 
 Sails over in silence though winds are loud, 
 Till the full moon in the east 
 Looks at the planet in the west 
 And earth is silent as it is black, 
 Yet not unhappy for its lack. 
 Up from the dirty earth men stare: 
 One imagines a refuge there 
 Above the mud, in the pure bright 
 Of the cloudless heavenly light: 
 Another loves earth and November more dearly 
 Because without them, he sees clearly, 
 The sky would be nothing more to his eye 
 Than he, in any case, is to the sky; 
 He loves even the mud whose dyes 
 Renounce all brightness to the skies.
