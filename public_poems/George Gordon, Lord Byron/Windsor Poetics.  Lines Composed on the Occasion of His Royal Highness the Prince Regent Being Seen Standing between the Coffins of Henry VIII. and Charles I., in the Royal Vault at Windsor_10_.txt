Windsor Poetics.  Lines Composed on the Occasion of His Royal Highness the Prince Regent Being Seen Standing between the Coffins of Henry VIII. and Charles I., in the Royal Vault at Windsor
George Gordon, Lord Byron

FAMED for contemptuous breach of sacred ties, 
 By headless Charles see heartless Henry lies; 
 Between them stands another sceptred thing-- 
 It moves, it reigns--in all but name, a king: 
  
   Charles to his people, Henry to his wife, 
 --In him the double tyrant starts to life: 
 Justice and Death have mixed their dust in vain, 
 Each royal Vampire wakes to life again. 
 Ah, what can tombs avail!--since these disgorge 
 The blood and dust of both--to mould a George.
