To Mary Shelley
Percy Bysshe Shelley

My dearest Mary, wherefore hast thou gone, 
 And left me in this dreary world alone? 
 Thy form is here indeed--a lovely one-- 
 But thou art fled, gone down the dreary road, 
 That leads to Sorrow's most obscure abode; 
 Thou sittest on the hearth of pale despair, 
 Where 
 For thine own sake I cannot follow thee.
