Farewell
Anne Bronte

Farewell to thee! but not farewell 
 To all my fondest thoughts of thee: 
 Within my heart they still shall dwell; 
 And they shall cheer and comfort me. 
 O, beautiful, and full of grace! 
 If thou hadst never met mine eye, 
 I had not dreamed a living face 
 Could fancied charms so far outvie. 
  
 If I may ne'er behold again 
 That form and face so dear to me, 
 Nor hear thy voice, still would I fain 
 Preserve, for aye, their memory. 
  
 That voice, the magic of whose tone 
 Can wake an echo in my breast, 
 Creating feelings that, alone, 
 Can make my tranced spirit blest. 
  
 That laughing eye, whose sunny beam 
 My memory would not cherish less; -- 
 And oh, that smile! whose joyous gleam 
 Nor mortal language can express. 
  
 Adieu, but let me cherish, still, 
 The hope with which I cannot part. 
 Contempt may wound, and coldness chill, 
 But still it lingers in my heart. 
  
 And who can tell but Heaven, at last, 
 May answer all my thousand prayers, 
 And bid the future pay the past 
 With joy for anguish, smiles for tears?
