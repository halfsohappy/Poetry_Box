A Dream
Edward Thomas

OVER known fields with an old friend in dream 
 I walked, but came sudden to a strange stream. 
 Its dark waters were bursting out most bright 
 From a great mountain's heart into the light. 
 They ran a short course under the sun, then back 
 Into a pit they plunged, once more as black 
 As at their birth; and I stood thinking there 
 How white, had the day shone on them, they were, 
 Heaving and coiling. So by the roar and hiss 
 And by the mighty motion of the abyss 
 I was bemused, that I forgot my friend 
 And neither saw nor sought him till the end, 
 When I awoke from waters unto men 
 Saying: "I shall be here some day again."
