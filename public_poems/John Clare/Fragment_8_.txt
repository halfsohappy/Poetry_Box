Fragment
John Clare

The cataract, whirling down the precipice, 
   Elbows down rocks and, shouldering, thunders through. 
 Roars, howls, and stifled murmurs never cease; 
   Hell and its agonies seem hid below. 
 Thick rolls the mist, that smokes and falls in dew; 
   The trees and greenwood wear the deepest green. 
 Horrible mysteries in the gulph stare through, 
   Roars of a million tongues, and none knows what they mean.
