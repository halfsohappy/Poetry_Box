Song
George Gordon, Lord Byron

Breeze of the night in gentler sighs 
   More softly murmur o'er the pillow; 
 For Slumber seals my Fanny's eyes, 
   And Peace must never shun her pillow. 
  
 Or breathe those sweet Ã†olian strains 
   Stolen from celestial spheres above, 
 To charm her ear while some remains, 
   And soothe her soul to dreams of love. 
  
 But Breeze of night again forbear, 
   In softest murmurs only sigh: 
 Let not a Zephyr's pinion dare 
   To lift those auburn locks on high. 
  
 Chill is thy Breath, thou breeze of night! 
   Oh! ruffle not those lids of Snow; 
 For only Morning's cheering light 
   May wake the beam that lurks below. 
  
 Blest be that lip and azure eye! 
   Sweet Fanny, hallowed be thy Sleep! 
 Those lips shall never vent a sigh, 
   Those eyes may never wake to weep.
