Liberty
Edward Thomas

THE last light has gone out of the world, except 
 This moonlight lying on the grass like frost 
 Beyond the brink of the tall elm's shadow 
 It is as if everything else had slept 
 Many an age, unforgotten and lost 
 The men that were, the things done, long ago, 
 All I have thought; and but the moon and I 
 Live yet and here stand idle over the grave 
 Where all is buried. Both have liberty 
 To dream what we could do if we were free 
 To do some thing we had desired long, 
 The moon and I. There's none less free than who 
 Does nothing and has nothing else to do, 
 Being free only for what is not to his mind, 
 And nothing is to his mind. If every hour 
 Like this one passing that I have spent among 
 The wiser others when I have forgot 
 To wonder whether I was free or not, 
 Were piled before me, and not lost behind, 
 And I could take and carry them away 
 I should be rich; or if I had the power 
 To wipe out every one and not again 
 Regret, I should be rich to be so poor. 
 And yet I still am half in love with pain, 
 With what is imperfect, with both tears and mirth, 
 With things that have an end, with life and earth, 
 And this moon that leaves me dark within the door.
